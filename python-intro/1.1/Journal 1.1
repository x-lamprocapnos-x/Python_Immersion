Exercise 1.1 Intro to Python
Learning Goals

Summarize the uses and benefits of Python for web development
Prepare your developers environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development?
 If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

 Answer: The differences between front end and backend web development in the simplest way explained is that 
 the front end is what the user sees and interacts (ie. buttons, forms, and content) with and 
 the backend is the logic and data handling (ie. passwords, data storage and organizing). If I were hired to work on a backend
 project I would most likely parsing through data and making sure everything on the front end worked properly, and if something 
 didn't work I would be on a hunt for the issue.

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future.
 Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice.
  How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team?
   Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

Answer: If I were a full-stack developer giving my opinion as to why our project should use python over JavaScript,
I would explain both languages are cross-platform and dynamic typing meaning they are compatable with many operating systems, and
you don't need to declare variables allowing flexibilty. However python is better mostly due to it's readability, 
working as a team will be easier, and debugging will be simpler. Python has one of the biggest supporting communities so any concerns 
or questions will most likely be easily answered as well.



3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement.
 You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you.
  What do you want to learn about Python? 
  What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
  Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

Answer: Three goals I have for this python course would be to fully understand how python can be used for automation and even game development,
I want to be able to confidently navigate python, and I would like to use python on my own for a new project without course guidance. After this Achievement
I absolutely need to redo my Portfolio website, perhaps I will use python for the backend logic.
