# **Intro-to-python**

## **Second Task**
- Create a recipe structures including "name", "cooking time", and "ingredients".
- Create a minimum of 5 recipes and add a structure called "All recipes" around them.
- Print the ingredients of all recipes.

### I felt it to be best to make the recipe structures and all recipes structure into dictionaries because tuples would not allow me the freedom of manipulation this project demands, lists can not provide me key-value pairs, and strings are basically tuples with manipulation capabilities. Dictionaries are the only viable option for labeling the information I accurately want to depict, and they provide the flexibilty I desire to create this project freely.
