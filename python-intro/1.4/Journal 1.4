Learning Goals

⦁	Use files to store and retrieve data in Python

Reflection Questions

1.	Why is file storage important when you’re using Python? What would happen if you didn’t store local files?

A:  file storage is important in python because losing your content after every run, will not only drive you insane but you won't be able to progress with your application.
In an example. If i add 5 recipes to a list, and try to go back and reference the content so I could display it, I would be unable to view anything because the reference would most likely throw an error.

2.	In this Exercise you learned about the pickling process with the pickle.dump() method. What are pickles? In which situations would you choose to use pickles and why? 

A: Pickles are code only a machine can read. Binary code can be used as a sort of security measure and its a great way to turn very complex data into a smaller file.

3.	In Python, what function do you use to find out which directory you’re currently in? What if you wanted to change your current working directory?

A: If you find yourself confused as to what directory you're working in, Python offers something called the "os module". To figure out what directory you're in
you can use os.cwd (current working directory), and if you'd like to change your directory you could use os.chdir (change directory).

4.	Imagine you’re working on a Python script and are worried there may be an error in a block of code. How would you approach the situation to prevent the entire script from terminating due to an error?

A: Errors as we all know can be very taxing, to prevent your code from stopping completely upon finding a code, you could add, try-except blocks which will act as if the code itself
is on alert for an error, and if there is no error where it was suspected to be, your code will run as usual. Secondly adding a finally block will continue the code run even if there is a return
before it. Following that an else statement could help because it works with the try and the finally blocks by handling the action upon finding an error in the try, and allowing the finally to run after it.

5.	You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 1! Take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something you’re struggling with? 
What do you need more practice with? Feel free to use these notes to guide your next mentor call. 

A: Intro to python is going pretty well I believe. I'm proud of myself for continueing my learning journey, this year has been difficult but with each task I'm one step closer to a new life. I struggle with
confidence in coding mostly. I know what I read, and I understand it but I feel like I learn best with repetition. I need more practice with more immersion, I keep wanting to
say object instead of dictionary, because to me a dictionary is very similar to an object. I fear going into the field, I will get the jargon wrong and sound uneducated.
