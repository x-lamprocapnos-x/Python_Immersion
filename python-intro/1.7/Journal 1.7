Learning Goals 

⦁ Interact with a database using an object-relational mapper 

⦁ Build your final command-line Recipe application 

Reflection Questions 

1. What is an Object Relational Mapper and what are the advantages of using one? 
A. An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a tool that allows developers to interact with a database using Python objects and classes instead of writing raw SQL queries.
ORMs simplify database operations by mapping Python classes to database tables, making it much easier to perform actions like creating, 
reading, updating, and deleting records without writing SQL manually. The advantages include portability, faster development, and improved readability and maintainabilty.
 

2. By this point, you’ve finished creating your Recipe app. How did it go? What’s something in the app that you did well with? If you were to start over, what’s something about your app that you would change or improve? 
A. Creating my Recipe app in Python went really well. I was able to quickly identify and resolve errors, especially when working with database queries and user input validation. 
I also enjoyed learning how to use SQLAlchemy and structuring my functions effectively. If I were to start over, I would add a category sorting function and a search feature that allows users to filter recipes by category. 
This would make it easier for users to find recipes based on meal types (e.g., breakfast, lunch, dinner, desserts). I believe It would also improve the app’s usability and provide a better experience for users.
 

3. Imagine you’re at a job interview. You’re asked what experience you have creating an app using Python. Taking your work for this Achievement as an example, draft how you would respond to this question. 
A. I recently developed a Python-based Recipe app, which allowed me to gain hands on experience with object relational mapping using SQLalchemy, as well as database management with mySQL.
The Recipe app project reinforced my understanding of key backend development concepts, such as defining models, handling user input, and performing CRUD operations on a database. Throughout the process,
I worked with various tools, including the IPython shell and mySQL command line, to interact with my database and debug efficiently. Python's versatility and readabilty made it an excellent language for this project,
and I really enjoyed structuring my code to ensure clarity and maintainabilty. I'm excited to continue improving ny skills and applying them to larger, real world applications.

⦁ You’ve finished Achievement 1! Before moving on to Achievement 2, take a moment to reflect on your learning in the course so far:  

1. What went well during this Achievement?
A. This achievement went very smoothly! I picked up on key Python concepts quickly, 
especially database interactions using SQLAlchemy. I was also able to debug issues efficiently, 
which made me feel more confident in my problem-solving skills.

2. What’s something you’re proud of?
A. I'm proud of how I've tackled small but impactful challenges, like reducing typos in my code. 
I now use search tools and carefully review my work to ensure accuracy. 
This has helped me write cleaner, error-free code and has made debugging much easier.

3. What was the most challenging aspect of this Achievement?
A. The biggest challenge was returning to my project after stepping away for a while. At first, I felt stuck, 
but I overcame this by rereading the course materials, redoing some exercises, and reviewing my previous work. 
This approach helped me regain momentum and reinforced what I had learned.

4. Did this Achievement meet your expectations? Did it give you the confidence to start working with your new Python skills?
A. This achievement was surprisingly easier than I expected, mainly because I became more comfortable using SQLAlchemy and the command line. 
Debugging became smoother, and I found myself writing code more confidently. This experience has reinforced my ability to problem-solve and work with Python effectively.

5. What’s something you want to keep in mind to help you do your best in Achievement 2?
A. To keep the momentum and success flowing in achievement 2, I want to stay focused. I'll set small goals for each study session,
and make sure to take notes when coding to reinforce my learning.
