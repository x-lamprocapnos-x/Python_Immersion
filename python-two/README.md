# Observation Project: [A2_Recipe_App]

### This section of the Repo contains my personal observations, journal entries, view points, and screenshots from "A2_Recipe_App", a seperate Django project that I experienced. "A2_Recipe_App" is my very first time working with Django, executed by following a course.

## **Folder Overview**
- Journal entries answering reflection questions
- Screenshots showing different states or stages of the project
- Notes and insights about what I learned or found interesting

## **Purpose of This Observations**
- The goal of this observation project was much like the journal entries and screenshots from "Python-Intro." After each lesson, I was meant to reflect on what I had just learned and explain how I viewed the material, so that my mentor might be able to gauge if my understanding was on the right track, and to prepare for interview questions.
