Reflect on what users might want to search, why. and what format the output might be best in.

A.1: I think users would like to search for 
- recipes by name, so that they can look up recipes under what they already know or have been told.
- food type, so that they can search for recipes given a certain meal type.
- recipes by ingredients, so they can gather some ideas on how to use what they may already have at home.
- cooking time, so they can have an accurate idea on how long they will be cooking before eating.
- difficulty, so they can maybe take a step back if they feel a difficulty is outside of their comfort zone.

Results are shown with both graphs and a table, 
as well as the bootstrap recipes cards with images and links to the details pages.
