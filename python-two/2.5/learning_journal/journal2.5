Learning Goals 
● Add images to the model and display them on the frontend of your application 
● Create complex views with access to the model 
● Display records with views and templates 

Reflection Questions 
1. In your own words, explain Django static files and how Django handles them. 

A. Static files in Django are any files that will not change dynamically (during runtime/execution/after compilation).
    The files usually include, css, images, or some javascript, these files don't come from the database, 
    they remain the same regardless of user interaction. Static files are placed in a static folder, you need to define the "STATIC_URL"
    in settings.py to set the base URL for accessing static files. You need to load static files in your templates using {%load static%} 
    and then <img src="{{object.pic.url}}" width="100" height="150" /> for example of an image.

2. Look up the following two Django packages on Django’s official documentation and/or other 
trusted sources. Write a brief description of each. 

Package ----- Description

ListView - A helpful class based view that's used to display a list of objects from a database model. 
            This package automatically queries the model and passes the results to a 
            template with a default context named "object list"

DetailView - Another useful class based view that displays more information about a single object from a model.
                it requires a "pk" or "slug" in the URL to identify which object to retrieve, and it passes 
                the object to the templet under the contect name "object".

3. You’re now more than halfway through Achievement 2! Take a moment to reflect on your learning 
in the course so far. How is it going? What’s something you’re proud of so far? Is there something 
you’re struggling with? What do you need more practice with? You can use these notes to guide 
your next mentor call. 

A. I'm excited to be half way through the python course, so far some things are familiar and i pick up on them easy, 
    like the class based views make sense to me. I got really excited when I learned about pickles. I never knew bin files could be "unpickled".
    I'm proud of myself for stiving to do my best in this course. Sometimes it's a bit much for my perfectionist trait but I just need to learn
    to relax and follow the course, it seems I put the wagon in front of the horse on some things, and end up doing double the work. I need more 
    practice with pickles, and the different syntax for the html {%comments%}, I started out the lesson putting all comments above the <!Doctype>.
