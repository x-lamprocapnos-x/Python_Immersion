Task-2.5 â€” Model Review and Updates

In Exercise 2.3, I created a single Recipe model with the following fields:

- name

- description

- ingredients

- cooking_time

Changes Made:
- Added author field: A ForeignKey to the built-in User model to track which user created the recipe.

- Added instructions field: To store detailed cooking steps beyond a brief description.

- Added image field: To allow image upload for visual enhancement.

(Optional) Added difficulty field: To store the calculated difficulty in the database for faster access and filtering.

- Updated save() method: Automatically sets the difficulty based on logic from calculate_difficulty().

2.5 Front end inspirations
My top three recipe websites are Tasty, Allrecipes, and philadelphia cream cheese by kraft heinz. 

- Tasty is so bright and cute, i love the bold lettering, the color contrast, and the recipe cards are all pictures that zoom in when you hover over them,

- Allrecipes has ratings, and heart so you could add a recipe to your favorites, and the drop down feature in each category across the top 
is so nice because you can find a specific category faster.

- Lastly I really like the kraft heinz philadelphia creeam cheese website because The design is sleek, the navigation at the top has a section about themselves, 
recipes, and their products. When you slect the recipe page, there are subsections for different meals, of the day, and an occasion and season filter.
I love that the different meal sections arent just titled, they're in pretty bubbles.
