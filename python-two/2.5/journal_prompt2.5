Task-2.5 â€” Model Review and Updates

In Exercise 2.3, I created a single Recipe model with the following fields:

- name

- description

- ingredients

- cooking_time

Changes Made:
- Added author field: A ForeignKey to the built-in User model to track which user created the recipe.

- Added instructions field: To store detailed cooking steps beyond a brief description.

- Added image field: To allow image upload for visual enhancement.

(Optional) Added difficulty field: To store the calculated difficulty in the database for faster access and filtering.

- Updated save() method: Automatically sets the difficulty based on logic from calculate_difficulty().
