Learning Goals 

Discuss Django models, the “M” part of Django’s MVT architecture 
Create apps and models representing different parts of your web application  
Write and run automated tests 

Reflection Questions 

1. Do some research on Django models. In your own words, write down how Django models work and what their benefits are. 

Django models are objects that define how you specifically want the data to be stored in the database. Models are extremely beneficial because
they authomatically create tables for your database, they allow you to interact with the database using ORM rather than raw sql queries, 
making clean readble code even better than python alone, Django models also comes with built in validation and even offers admin interface integration.


2. In your own words, explain why it is crucial to write test cases from the beginning of a project. You can take an example project to explain your answer. 

For starters, I love writing tests! Writing tests from the beginning of a project is crucial because it helps ensure your code works
as expected every step of the way. Tests not only catch bugs early, but they also clarify what functionality is needed.
its like building a blueprint before the actual constuction begins. The first time I followed a test driven development (TDD)
approach, I worked on an app called "Meet" that found, compared, and updated local events using Google Calendar. I wrote tests first,
and they helped me guide how i structured the components. Even ensuring things like certain elements loaded in the correct order. 
Testing game me confidence in my code and saved me tons of time in the long run.
